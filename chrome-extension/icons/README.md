# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for the extension toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for the extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for the Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Note

For now, you can use any PNG images with these names and sizes, or create simple colored squares. The extension will work without these files, but Chrome may show warnings.

## Icon Design

The icon should represent:
- ðŸ“¥ Download/automation concept
- ðŸ“Š Data/analytics theme
- âš¡ Speed/automation
- ðŸŽ¯ Targeting/precision

Suggested colors: Blue (#007bff) and green (#28a745) to match the UI.
